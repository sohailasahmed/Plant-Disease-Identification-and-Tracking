A CNN based Plant Disease Identification, Tracking and Forecasting Solution. 
It is so simple that Farmers can just click picture of the infected plant leaf and upload it to our web app. 
Our model detects the Disease by using CNN and displays the Type of Disease and Solution for the Disease. 
It is helpful for both farmers and agricultural experts to timely detect the disease and take appropriate measures soon to avoid spread of disease. 
For now the model is trained for demo with very few disease but later extended to vaious types. 
In further extension(upcoming version) we are also going to implement Forecasting on a real time Map where the disease is found, helping farmers to reach the infected places to gain more insights and knowledge about the diseases.
