A CNN based Plant Disease Identificaion, Tracking and Forecasting Solution Providing in which we help farmers. Farmers can just click photo of the plant leaf and upload it to our web app. It detects the Disease by using CNN and displays the Type of Disease and Solution for the Disease. It is helpful for both farmers and agricultural experts to timely detect the disease and take appropriate measures to save it. In further extension(upcoming version) we are going to implement Forecasting on a real time Map where the disease is found, helping farmers to reach the infected places to gain more insights and knowledge about the diseases.For now we have trained our model with limited disease only approx 15-20 diseases. But further we will extend it with approximately all kind of diseases.
